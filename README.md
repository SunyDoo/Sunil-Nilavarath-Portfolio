# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

My name is Sunil Nilavarath. I am a highly motivated, passionate, and ambitious Full Stack Software Engineer with a growth mindset. My recent career has been as a Respiratory Therapist with 8 years of experience in healthcare, where I developed strong skills in analytical thinking and an ability to thrive in fast-paced, challenging, and collaborative work environments to deliver life-saving care to patients in a critical care setting. While I enjoyed my current profession, my passion has always been in tech and pursuing a career as a software engineer. With the birth of my twins, I felt that it would be a good time to set forth on a new career path. In my time as an RT, Iâ€™ve learned how to work smarter when faced with new challenges. Even in the most stressful situations, I remain calm and task-oriented because I know I have a job that needs to be done. I look forward to growing my coding skills to develop new and exciting projects as a Software Engineer. I eagerly look forward to any and all opportunities that come!
